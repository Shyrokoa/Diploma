Genetic programming applied to automatic filter design

The aim of this work was to develop the implementation of the genetic algorithm
in the application for automatic filter design. The work required the development
of the evolutionary process of filters and their specific implementation in the Java
programming language, followed by analysis and testing in the Matlab program.
